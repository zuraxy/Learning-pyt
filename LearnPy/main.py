print(song)
this is the song name  
print(artist)
The official artist/youtube channel of the song  
print(genre)
I am not really good at differentiating genres thus idk
print(year)
The year of the publishment
print(month)
The month when it is published
print(day)
The day when it is published 
print(duration)
The duration or length of the song
print(similar_artist)

This is all the relevant information I gathered
There would be more but I thought that this is sufficient thus did not bother adding more
